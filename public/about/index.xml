      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, I became qualified to work with animals in a lab after completing my Animal Care and Use Training, which included learning rodent euthanasia. In this procedure, rodents are placed in a chamber and exposed to a controlled flow of carbon dioxide. The gradual increase in carbon dioxide displaces the oxygen, leading to unconsciousness with minimal pain, and ultimately death when the concentration is high enough. A secondary method, such as cervical dislocation, bilateral thoracotomy, or decapitation, is then employed to ensure death.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
