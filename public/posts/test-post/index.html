                    <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Earlier this year, I became qualified to work with animals in a lab after completing my Animal Care and Use Training, which included learning rodent euthanasia. In this procedure, rodents are placed in a chamber and exposed to a controlled flow of carbon dioxide. The gradual increase in carbon dioxide displaces the oxygen, leading to unconsciousness with minimal pain, and ultimately death when the concentration is high enough. A secondary method, such as cervical dislocation, bilateral thoracotomy, or decapitation, is then employed to ensure death.</p>
<p>While this topic is unsettling for many, it is crucial to confront those uneasy truths. Every year, over 120 million mice and rats are used in research, with the majority being euthanized at the end of their studies (Cait et al.). Laboratory animals are often already treated more humanely than those in the factory meat industry, during game hunting, or those suffering from habitat destruction. An honest examination of the philosophical basis and ethical justifications of animal treatment is the first step in striving toward more humane and sustainable approaches. In this exploration, I will examine four predominant ethical frameworks that currently guide our interactions with animals. I will highlight the distinct challenges each framework presents and introduce my own proposal that seeks to integrate the strengths of these existing approaches. By combining practical effectiveness with a well-rounded ethical perspective, this proposed framework aims to refine and improve the ethical standards of animal research.</p>
<h3 id="the-so-like-us-approach">The &lsquo;So Like Us&rsquo; Approach</h3>
<p>In Discourse on Method, published in 1637, French mathematician and philosopher René Descartes asserted “I think, therefore I am,” suggesting that one can confirm their own existence through the undoubtable reality of their thoughts (Descartes). This foundational idea provides a logical starting point for considering our relationship with animals. If humans are accorded a variety of legal rights due to our cognitive capabilities, then why should not animals with similar capacities also be granted a certain degree of legal personhood and rights? This notion aligns with the ancient Scala Naturae, which depicts a hierarchical world order from divine to mundane, with humans at the apex and beings like insects and sponges at the base. I refer to this as the “so like us” approach, a concept also supported by Darwin&rsquo;s theory of evolution. For Darwinians, if humans have climbed to the top of nature’s ladder, then apes and other creatures that have ascended nearly as far should also deserve special consideration. Together, these perspectives reinforce the intuitive notion that beings with human-like qualities should be recognized for their similar capacities and granted corresponding rights.</p>
<p>The “so like us” approach is perhaps best exemplified by animal rights lawyer Steven Wise, who, in his book Rattling the Cage, discusses how chimpanzees and bonobos are strikingly similar to humans. He cites their self-consciousness, self-direction, possession of a theory of mind, and their ability to transcend mere instinct as evidence of this similarity. Wise argues that the stark division traditionally made between humans and &lsquo;autonomous animals&rsquo;—those that lead &lsquo;autonomous lives&rsquo;—is irrational and warrants reassessment. He advocates for granting these species the same rights as children and individuals with cognitive disabilities, including the right to be represented in a court of law (Wise).</p>
<p>The advantages of the “so like us” approach are clear: it is straightforward and effectively appeals to the pathos of audiences by highlighting the cognitive and emotional similarities between humans and animals. However, it is often criticized for anthropomorphizing animals and overlooking the diversity of species. This results in a narrow scope, limiting protection only to animals that exhibit human-like qualities and potentially excluding countless other species that, though not similar, still possess intrinsic ecological and ethical value. As one of the most influential frameworks in animal ethics, these limitations are also reflected in our legislation. Rats, mice, and birds, perceived as dissimilar to humans, are not classified as USDA-regulated species like primates are. Consequently, they lack protections under the Animal Welfare Act, underscoring a significant ethical and legal gap. This discrepancy highlights the need for a philosophical approach that includes the welfare of all species.</p>
<h3 id="utilitarianism">Utilitarianism</h3>
<p>To address the challenges of anthropocentrism and the narrow scope inherent in the “so like us” approach, British utilitarian philosopher Jeremy Bentham proposed a pivotal shift in perspective by questioning, “Can animals suffer?” instead of “Can animals reason?”. Bentham emphasized that ethical considerations should focus on pleasure and pain, which he argued differ only in quantity, not quality (Bentham). Advocating for a utilitarian approach to animal ethics, he aimed to maximize the net balance of pleasure over pain. This approach not only sensitively recognizes the potential for animals to suffer due to human actions, but also evaluates such suffering using a universal metric applicable to all animals. By doing so, Bentham directly assaults the human-centric arrogance seen in the previous approach.</p>
<p>Peter Singer, an Australian moral philosopher and Professor of Bioethics at Princeton University, is a close follower of Bentham’s ideas, his book Animal Liberation, published in 1975, is often regarded as the foundational text of the animal rights movement. In the book, Singer specifically highlights the use of rabbits in Draize eye tests, where chemicals are dripped into the rabbits&rsquo; eyes to observe irritation effects. This procedure often results in intense pain and possibly blindness for the rabbits, which Singer points out as a clear example of prioritizing minor human interests (i.e. cosmetic products) over significant animal suffering (Singer).</p>
<p>Although being a step ahead of the “so like us” approach, there are still two major shortcomings of the utilitarian approach to animal ethics. First, this approach acknowledges only one aspect of animal lives by prioritizing the importance of suffering and pleasure. While this focus is important, it is deemed insufficient as it reduces animal welfare to mere sensations, failing to see other vital aspects such as social interaction and freedom, which are also essential for animal well-being. Secondly, the utilitarian method risks the dangerous aggregation of animal experiences, thus overlooking individuality. By assessing the value of actions based solely on the total balance of pleasure over pain, utilitarianism devalues the individual, treating the experiences of beings as mere variables in a broader and often inaccurate calculation rather than recognizing their intrinsic value.</p>
<p>Singer argues that the Draize eye tests are unethical because the minor pleasure gained does not justify the intense suffering caused (Singer). This raises a key question about the utilitarian calculus: if the balance is reversed, and the benefits outweigh the suffering, does it make such cruel experiments ethical? In the lab where I work, we often conduct procedures that result in significant animal suffering to find treatments for critical human diseases, such as cancer. We drain blood while the hearts of mice are still beating; we surgically remove the liver and gall bladder from live mice; we insert catheters into mice’s stomachs, and induce alcoholic hepatitis by directly pumping alcohol into their systems (Ueno et al.). These actions subject animals to horrendous conditions in the name of science, justified by the potential benefit to tens of thousands of patients if the experiments yield successful treatments. Such examples are tragic in nature, and illustrate the limitations of the utilitarian approach, underscoring the need for a more comprehensive framework that better respects individual animal welfare.</p>
<h3 id="kantian-ethics-and-the-problem-of-means">Kantian Ethics and the Problem of Means</h3>
<p>A Kantian approach offers a radical solution to the above tragic conflict. In the Second Formulation of the Categorical Imperative, German philosopher Immanuel Kant notes, “So act that you use humanity, in your own person as well as in the person of any other, always at the same time as an end, never merely as means.” While Kant himself considers animals to be lacking the capacity for ethical choices, moral philosopher Christine Korsgaard presents a more nuanced view in her 2018 book Fellow Creatures: Our Obligations to the Other Animals. Korsgaard suggests that our duties to animals should blend Aristotelian and Kantian philosophy, recognizing animals as sentient beings with complex, self-maintaining systems who pursue good and matters to themselves, and thus deserving to be treated as ends-in-themselves (Korsgaard, Fellow Creatures).</p>
<p>Korsgaard criticizes the current human treatment of animals as “a moral atrocity of enormous proportions.” She specifically targets utilitarianism for its failure to recognize animals as ends in themselves, accusing it of treating them merely as means to human ends. This approach, she argues, wrongly subsumes the value of individual lives under aggregated outcomes. According to Korsgaard, animal experiments are morally unjustifiable because they treat animals as tools rather than as beings entitled to ethical consideration. She asserts that animals, like humans, possess innate value and that their welfare should not be sacrificed for the benefit of another creature. Thus, Korsgaard argues that animal experiments should not be conducted under any circumstances (Korsgaard, Medical Research on Animals).</p>
<p>Korsgaard is among the very few animal ethics scholars who call for an abrupt termination of all animal research. While her critique of utilitarianism is insightful by highlighting the importance of individuality, it is generally considered reasonable to acknowledge the substantial benefits derived from such research, including benefits that could extend to animals themselves. Korsgaard’s stance is impractical given our current scientific and biomedical capabilities. Much of the complex mechanisms within living organisms remain poorly understood and cannot be fully explored through in vitro (outside living organisms) or in silico (computational) experiments alone. In vivo (within living organisms) experiments remain the most reliable method to ensure the safety, efficacy, and effectiveness of new treatments. Adopting Korsgaard&rsquo;s approach would necessitate a major shift in both practice and policy, likely hindering crucial scientific advancements.</p>
<h3 id="the-capabilities-approach">The Capabilities Approach</h3>
<p>With acknowledgment of the challenges faced by Korsgaard’s Kantian approach, legal and philosophy scholar Martha Nussbaum proposed a more comprehensive framework, the capabilities approach, in her book Justice for Animals: Our Collective Responsibility published in 2023. Nussbaum’s capabilities approach critically advances beyond traditional ethical frameworks by emphasizing what animals are actually able to do and to be, in a way that respects their inherent dignity. She outlines a set of “central capabilities” that should be supported including bodily integrity, emotions, affiliation, and play among others. These capabilities suggest that ethical considerations should enable all creatures to live a life that allows them to flourish according to their own unique biological and psychological traits (Nussbaum).</p>
<p>Rather than solely focusing on minimizing suffering or treating animals as ends in themselves, the capabilities approach offers a multifaceted solution and facilitates conditions that enhance the positive life experiences of animals across species. Its weakness is also apparent, as it provides only a set of suggestive goals rather than a clear guide for action. Additionally, its position on animal experiments is somewhat unclear, calling merely for consideration of each species&rsquo; unique capabilities during research, which makes practical implementation difficult.</p>
<h3 id="toward-an-integrated-ethical-framework">Toward an Integrated Ethical Framework</h3>
<p>Each of the approaches discussed in this essay brings its own challenges. They are often either too narrow in scope, perceived as too radical, or too difficult to implement. However, it is crucial to note that these frameworks are not mutually exclusive. By synthesizing their ideals, it is possible to develop an actionable and inclusive framework, that respects both the animals and the researcher involved in medical studies, as well as the patients who benefit from it.</p>
<h3 id="breaking-the-cycle-of-neglect">Breaking the Cycle of Neglect</h3>
<p>Too often, we find ourselves trapped in a vicious cycle when discussing animal ethics in the context of medical experiments. We treat experimental animals as mere means to an end; this leads to inadequate care and a poor understanding of their needs (Engber). To date, there is still no consensus on the optimal dosage for postoperative analgesics for mice (Matsumiya) or the ideal temperature settings for their comfort (Gaskill). Consequently, this neglect results in stressed animals, which can skew research results, and decrease both the replicability and the translatability of the studies to human conditions, thereby casting doubts on the overall reliability of animal experiments (Dhabhar). This low reliability necessitates more experiments, perpetuating the cycle.</p>
<h3 id="animals-as-both-means-and-ends">Animals as Both Means and Ends</h3>
<p>To break this cycle, I propose a paradigm shift where animals are seen not only as means but also as ends in themselves. This dual perspective is a nuanced interpretation of Kantian ethics. Unlike Christine Korsgaard, who argues that treating animals as ends-in-themselves categorically prohibits their use in experiments, I believe that Kant’s principle to “always [treat sentient beings] at the same time as an end, never merely as means.” We can, and should, conduct animal research ethically, ensuring that such research is designed and carried out with the utmost respect for the animals&rsquo; dignity and welfare.</p>
<p>Under this proposed framework, a heightened awareness of animal conditions, such as those experienced by mice, would encourage more comprehensive policymaking. This could serve as a moral motivation to address legislative gaps, like those in the Animal Welfare Act, thereby extending protections to species currently overlooked due to perceived differences. Furthermore, this new framework would require that researchers always prioritize the advancement of scientific understanding, rather than being driven by personal gain.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>As Martha Nussbaum highlighted, “Animals are in trouble all over the world.” This global crisis necessitates a nuanced and effective strategy that respects both animal welfare and medical research needs. The proposed approach aligns with utilitarian principles by potentially reducing suffering and enhancing outcomes, and fulfills the capabilities approach by allowing animals to lead fulfilling lives. This approach benefits all involved, not just those concerned with animal welfare. By potentially reducing the number of animals required for research, increasing the efficiency, and enhancing results applicability, we can accelerate the development of new treatments. Adopting this comprehensive ethical model is not only morally favorable but also a pragmatic strategy that promises more reliable, humane, and innovative scientific advances.</p>
